# Qtile-Collection
In this repo I create widgets for qtile.
[Here](https://github.com/1fadi/Arch/blob/main/.config/qtile/core/bar.py) is an example of how I used the widgets in my config.

### Usage
As for now, you can clone this repo and move "widgets/" to the same directory where your qtile "config.py" is in.
And then you can start using any widget by importing it in your config file
like so: `from widgets.network import Network` this will import The Network widget.
